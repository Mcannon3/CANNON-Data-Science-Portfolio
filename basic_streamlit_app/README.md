# Basic Streamlit App
Streamlit is a Python framework to help create data apps for machine learning and data science with only a few lines of code.

# How to run the app

First you need to install streamlit which I did using anaconda prompt. I created a new environment within the 'basic_streamlit_app' folder, then activated the environment, and finally installed streamlit. 
After you have the app installed you can run it with the following command
'streamlit run basic_streamlit_app/main.py'
